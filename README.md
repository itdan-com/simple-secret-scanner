# simple-secret-scanner

Simple command-line tool to scan for hardcoded secrets in files.

Hardcoding secrets (like API keys or passwords) directly into source code is a major security risk. If the code is ever made public or accessed by an unauthorized user, these secrets are exposed, potentially leading to compromised accounts and significant data breaches. This tool helps mitigate that risk by scanning for such secrets before they are committed.
